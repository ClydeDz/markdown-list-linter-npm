* ðŸ’» [A CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-list-linter-cli) that you can run in your terminal

## Installation

You can install this package in your JavaScript or Typescript project.

```shell
npm install markdown-list-linter
```

## Usage

Very simple to use, all results will be container in the returned object.

```typescript
import { lintMarkdownList } from '../src/markdown-list-linter'

const results = lintMarkdownList('./path/to/markdown/file.md')
console.log(results)
```

When there are no errors, the returned object should look something like this.

```json
{ 'summary': 'No errors found' }
```

When there are errors, the returned object should look something like this.

```json
{
  'summary': 'Markdown list needs to be sorted', 
  'errorObject': [
      {
          'type': 'HEADINGS',
          'message': 'Please correct the alphabetical order for these heading items',                        
          'details': [
            ['C'],
            ['D', 'A']
          ],
      },
      {
          'type': 'LIST_ITEMS',
          'message': 'Please correct the alphabetical order for these list items',
          'details': [
            [
                `[African Buffalo]('https://www.AfricanBuffalo.com')`,
                `[Aardwolf]('https://www.Aardwolf.com')`
            ],
            [
                `[Chameleon]('https://www.Chameleon.com')`,
                `[Camel]('https://www.Camel.com')`,
                `[Cheetah]('https://www.Cheetah.com')`,
                `[Canary]('https://www.Canary.com')`
            ]
          ],
      }
  ]
}
```

The array items in the `details` object is sections in the list which need to be reordered.
